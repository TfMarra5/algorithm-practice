# Algorithm Practice – Project

This repository contains a project developed for the **Algorithm Practice** course.  
The goal is to implement and analyze algorithms that solve real-world problems in education, geometry, data processing, recommendation systems, biometrics, smart kitchens, and core CS concepts.

The project is organized into nine main tasks, each focusing on a different algorithmic area.

## 📂 Project Structure (Tasks)

### 1. Reading & Learning Optimisation

Formulates four algorithms aimed at improving reading comprehension in schools, including ideas such as:

- Adaptive learning based on student performance
- Personalized question generation
- Comprehension tracking over time
- Gamified reading challenges

### 2. Geometry in Practice

Implements an algorithm (e.g., in Java, Python, or C++) to:

- Calculate the **area** and **circumference** of a circle
- Extend the logic to real-world use cases such as:
  - Land plot calculations
  - Wheel and gear design
  - Satellite coverage estimations

### 3. Unit Conversion with Real-World Relevance

Builds a scalable unit-conversion system that:

- Converts distances between **kilometers** and **miles**
- Can be extended to other units, such as:
  - Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit
  - Liters ↔ gallons
  - Additional metric/imperial conversions

### 4. Finding Extremes in Data

Creates algorithms to:

- Determine the smallest value among four user-input numbers
- Extend to **min/max search** in larger datasets (e.g., streaming data, database queries, or IoT sensor readings)

### 5. Personalized E-commerce Recommendations

Outlines the logic behind an Amazon-style recommendation system using:

- **Collaborative filtering**
- **Content-based filtering**
- **Hybrid approaches** combining multiple strategies

### 6. Personalized Media Suggestions

Designs an algorithm for a Netflix-like movie suggestion system using machine learning concepts such as:

- Matrix factorization
