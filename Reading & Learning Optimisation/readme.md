# Reading & Learning Optimisation (4 Algorithms) — Java

The project involves developing and implementing four distinct algorithms. Made to boost reading comprehension skills in an educational setting. I wrote all the algorithms in Java, I kept the structure simple so it's easy to read and focuses on the algorithm itself.
